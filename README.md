# Smolcheck
A small and simple Hindley-Milner-based type inference engine for a statically typed extended lambda calculus.

My aim is to keep this fairly general, though the primary motivation for this stemmed as a way to learn more about type theory, there is also hope of establishing some reusable code for use in future compiler-related projects.
