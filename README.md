# Smolcheck
A small and simple Hindley-Milner and Algorithm W based type inference engine for a statically typed extended lambda calculus.

My aim is to try and keep this somewhat generic -- at least enough for me to use or trampoline off of in other things. Though the primary motivation for this stemmed as a way to learn more about type theory, there is also hope of establishing some reusable code for use in current or future compiler-related projects.
